RSS is aiming to be a spec compliant RSS/Atom Feed Parser (and maybe Generator? Discuss [here](https://github.com/kiliankoe/RSS/issues/4)) with a comfortable *swifty* API.

It's not very close to having reached that goal at the current time. Please check back later 🙃

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

RSS is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "RSS"
```

Or via Carthage, whatever you prefer. Just add the following to your Cartfile:

```
github "kiliankoe/RSS"
```

## Quick Start

coming soon :)
